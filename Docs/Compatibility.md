# Compatibility
This section outlines best practices to ensure backward and forward compatibility when evolving an API. Following these guidelines helps
prevent breaking changes, maintain seamless integration with existing clients, and ensure that new features can be introduced without
disrupting the current user base. This promotes a stable and reliable API experience, fostering long-term adoption and ease of maintenance.

## General Guidelines
<br>


### Avoid ignoring unknown input fields in the message payload by returning an error with an HTTP 400 status code
To maintain strict validation and ensure the integrity of API requests, avoid silently ignoring unknown input fields in the message
payload. Instead, return a clear error response, such as an HTTP `400 Bad Request` status code, to inform clients that the request
includes invalid or unexpected data. This approach prevents confusion, ensures clients are aware of any incorrect usage, and reinforces
proper use of the API.

By validating payloads and rejecting requests with unknown fields, you can reduce potential security risks, prevent data pollution,
and make the API behavior more predictable and reliable. Clear feedback also helps developers quickly identify mistakes and adjust
their client requests accordingly.

**Key Points:**
- **Enhances clarity and transparency**: Clients are informed of mistakes rather than unknowingly submitting invalid data.
- **Improves security**: Rejecting unknown fields reduces the attack surface by avoiding unanticipated inputs.
- **Reinforces proper API usage**: Ensures clients adhere to the API’s expected schema and structure.

**Example of an invalid request with unknown fields:**
```http
POST /api/v1/users
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john.doe@example.com",
  "age": 30,  // Valid field
  "unexpectedField": "some value"  // Unknown field
}
```

**Response:**
```http
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "error": "Unknown field: unexpectedField"
}
```

In this example, the API rejects the request and returns an error message indicating that an unknown field was provided.

### Avoid ignoring unknown input fields in the URI by returning an error with an HTTP 400 status code
To ensure that API requests are accurately formed and to prevent unexpected behavior, avoid silently accepting unknown fields
in the URI. Instead, return an HTTP `400 Bad Request` status code to clearly indicate that the request contains invalid or
unexpected parameters. This approach improves clarity and helps clients understand when their requests do not meet the API’s
expected format.

Validating the structure of the URI and rejecting any unknown fields ensures consistency, enhances security, and reduces
potential errors caused by incorrect parameters.

**Key Points:**
- **Promotes consistency**: Ensures that only recognized fields are processed by the API.
- **Improves error detection**: Clients are informed when they provide invalid parameters, helping them correct requests faster.
- **Enhances security**: Prevents the potential misuse of unanticipated or undefined URI fields.

**Example of an invalid request with unknown fields in the URI:**
```http
GET /api/v1/users/123/profile/unexpectedField
```

**Response:**
```http
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "error": "Unknown URI field: unexpectedField"
}
```

In this example, the API rejects the request due to the presence of an unrecognized field (`unexpectedField`) in the URI and returns an error message to the client.
