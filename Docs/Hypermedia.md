# Hypermedia
Hypermedia is a key feature of REST that enables APIs to guide clients dynamically by including links, actions, and
metadata in responses. It allows clients to navigate resources, perform operations, and discover related endpoints
without relying solely on hardcoded URLs or external documentation. By embedding contextual links and controls, 
hypermedia ensures flexibility, enhances discoverability, and promotes decoupling between client and server.
